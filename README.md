# NessaHours

NessaHours is a user-friendly work hours tracking app designed to help individuals log, calculate, and manage their work hours efficiently. Originally developed to satisfy the needs of a single user, this app is a **prototype with a larger vision**: to become a fully customizable work hours tracker where each user can tailor the experience to fit their unique needs. 

Imagine a work tracking app where **you** decide on the design—background images, button colors, page layout, and more—directly within the app itself. NessaHours aims to make this vision a reality.
